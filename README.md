> “In this competition you are given multiple images of each of 74 Earth locations and you are asked to develop an algorithm to fuse them together into a single one. The result will be a "super-resolved" image that is checked against a high resolution image taken from the same satellite, [PROBA-V][probav_wikipedia].”
